# InfiniRunner
An infinite runner game currently in development, made in [Unity DOTS](https://unity.com/dots).

Unity DOTS uses an Entity-Component-System architecture (ECS) which allows for better scaling of complex computations. All of this means that games have to be designed in a data oriented manor rather than in the typical object oriented paradigm.

This is my rather sordid attempt at using this experimental technology
